# Overview

With this project, I decided to learn the common language of Python. Despite
being exposed to it previously, I had never learned it before. I decided
to learn how it is used for data analysis.

The dataset I analyzed came from Kaggle.com. It is a 100% complete collection of data
taken from the official Fifa World Cup 2022 results. It can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/die9origephit/fifa-world-cup-2022-complete-dataset). The data lists
information from each individual game, including a game's category, date and time, teams
playing, fouls incurred, and more.

My purpose was to create a program to analyze information about the games in the
Fifa World Cup 2022 and discover answers to some simple questions.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the data set, the questions and answers, the code running and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Data Analysis Results

Question 1: How many total in-game penalty goals were scored from the start of the Quarter-finals up to and including the Final game?

Answer: 6

Question 2: What three teams incurred the most fouls across the whole World Cup 2022?

1st Place: ARGENTINA

2nd Place: CROATIA

3rd Place: FRANCE

# Future Work

* I could add another question to become more familiar with Pyhton and Pandas
* Improve the strategy of moving and adding values from a dataframe into less expensive data types
